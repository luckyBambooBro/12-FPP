- if our data is imcomplete, say missing a key then what happens? right now i think the school 
just wouldnt show up in the filtered list. e.g. if christian brothers college was missing the 
preschool data because we couldnt find it, if the user were to select preschool, then christian brothers
college wouldnt make the filtered list, even though it does have preschool (and we dont know it). this
might be ok to leave it like this, but good to keep in mind 

- returning empty lists in load_schools_data.py. better to sys.exit(1)?

- sort_schools_data.py. theres a line that was failing testing although it seems ok now (even
though i didnt make any changes to it). needs retesting. its this line:
 address = input("Please enter your address:\n>") 
 theres a #TODO to mark it
 consider the "requests" library that gemini suggested if i can be bothered...
